# Contributing to MRIQCeption

### Welcome to the repository for MRIQCeption!

We're so excited you're here and would like to contribute. 
We welcome contributions of any size and from any skill level, and would love to hear from you - opening [issues](https://github.com/elizabethbeard/mriqception/issues) and submitting [pull requests](https://github.com/elizabethbeard/mriqception/pulls) are highly encouraged!

### Getting Started
In order to contribute via GitHub you'll need to set up a free account and sign in. 
Here are some [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/) to help you get going. 
We value reproducible, open science, and highly recommend [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/introduction/introduction) as a resource if you have questions along the way or would like to explore this area.      

### Guidelines
Most of the writing that you'll do will be in [Markdown][markdown].
You can think of Markdown as a few little symbols around your text that will allow GitHub to render the text with a little bit of formatting.
For example, you could write words as **bold** (`**bold**`), or in _italics_ (`_italics_`), or as a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)(`[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)`) to another webpage.

When writing in Markdown, please start each new sentence on a new line.  
While this formats in the same way as if the new line wasn't included, it makes the [diffs produced during the pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-comparing-branches-in-pull-requests) review easier to read! :sparkles:

GitHub has a helpful page on [getting started with writing and formatting on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github) as well.

Looking forward to hearing from you! Thanks for helping us build this useful resource :smile:
