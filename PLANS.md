# Features to add / future goals

Things we'd potentially like to do, but won't get to this week.

_*Ideas*_:

* Create a better user interface to input your data.
* Display "normative" datapoints colored by crowdsourced ratings for that image (_Exclude, Poor, Acceptable, Excellent_), if available from the web API.
* Ability to automatically get relevant acquisition parameters from the BIDS dataset JSON files and plug them into the web API query, rather than the user having to manually select them.
* Query web API by additional conditions and combinations of parameters.
* Integrate with <a href="https://github.com/poldracklab/mriqc">MRIQC</a> group HTML reports?
